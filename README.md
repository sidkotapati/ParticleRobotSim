Creating a simulation stack for particle robots that can both rotate about each other and expand/contract.

The eventual goal of this project is to model -> study -> reproduce emergent behaviors that agents with these simple sets of actions can produce, as well as provide a library for others to experiment with, so that they can do the same.
